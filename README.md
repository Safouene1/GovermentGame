# Description : 
This is my first time writing a 2d game.
You play as the Tunisian Goverment to fight COVID-19. 
Your decisions matter and every day you pass you need to be economically stable.

Thanks to Unity I was able to export a [web demo on here](https://safouene1.github.io/GovermentGame/)


This project was part of my studies in Higher Institute of Computer science and Multimedia.
